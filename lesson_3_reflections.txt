When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you are working on a group project with more than one people.
  when you are working on an open source project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures your working area remains clean and you dont get unneeded updates which could mess with your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are copies of another person's github repository
    they exist directly on github
    clones are copies of repositories from github to a local directory
    branches are versions of code stored locally

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can perform fast forward merges and your commit history is not cluttered down with merge commits for linear merges.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Probably using email or an IM service.
    Git is definitely easier as it provides a more uniform platform
    in the sense that you only need a working bash prompt, github account
    and urls to collaborate. 
    it also provides the entire version control history, which is really useful.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    working directly on master makes the pull request process much easier
    on the other hand, keeping separate branches makes sure your official/ main code remains relatively bug free and you dont have to keep rechecking for bugs
